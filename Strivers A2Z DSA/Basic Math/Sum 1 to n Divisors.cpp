Sum 1 to n Divisors - GFG

Given a positive integer n, The task is to find the value of Î£i F(i) where i is from 1 to n and function F(i) is defined as the sum of all divisors of i.

Examples:

Input: n = 4
Output: 15
Explanation:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
So, F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4)
    = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15
Input: n = 5
Output: 21
Explanation:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
F(5) = 1 + 5 = 6
So,  F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4) + F(5)
    = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 = 21
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation:
F(1) = 1
So,  F(1) = 1 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105

//Intuition: observe the series for n = 5
//sum = 1 + (1+2) + (1+3) + (1+2+4) + (1+5)
//sum = (1*5) + (2*2) + (3*1) + (4*1) + (5*1) :: 1 added 5 times, 2 added 2 times...
//sum = (1*(5/1)) + (2*(5/2)) + (3*(5/3)) + (4*(5/4)) + (5*(5/5))
// so pattern is sum = sum + (i * (n/i))

class Solution {
  public:
    int sumOfDivisors(int n) {
        // Write Your Code here
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            sum += i * (n/i);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
